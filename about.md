# About Us

K_sig is the premier Systematic Investing club at Columbia University. As a group of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, economists, and investors, we seek to create exceptional returns through empirically informed and quantitatively grounded insights. Our culture is defined by an **insatiable curiosity**, as we aim to understand more deeply the modern strategies and implementation used in the quantitative investment industry.

We pride ourselves on our deep connection to modern academia, and of our intense focus on quantitaitve studies. As a group of **dogmatic empiricisits**, K_sig focuses both on the implementation of proven strategies, and the discovery of novel ones. Our investment decisions are systematically guided, with little room for personal bias. **Meritocracy** is at the cornerstone of our character; we are confident that success comes to those who are hardest working and most persistent.
